b) use texcoords/fragment shader to color edges (how to control thickness?)

camera/perspective transform and controls


textured turtle images

load complex 3d mesh

defer turtle moving/removal until render, and do a whole array compaction, to
perform better when multiple turtles are (re)moved in a frame

per turtle z-buffer for ordering indepentent of shape buffer draw order
